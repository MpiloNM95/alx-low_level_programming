<h4>Task 0:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c</li>
<li>his file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.</li>
<li>You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it!</li>
<li>However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.</li>
<li>Only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.</li>
<li>Not allowed o add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Task 1:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.</li>
<li>Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.</li>
<li>You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Task 2:</h4>
<ol>
<li>This program prints the largest of three integers.</li>
<li>? That’s definitely not right.</li>
<li>Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.</li>
<li>Line count will not be checked for this task.<li>
</ol>
<h4>Task 3:</h4>
<ol>
<li>This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.</li>
<li>Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Let’s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000.</li>
<li>? That doesn’t seem right.</li>
<li>Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.</li>
<li>Line count will not be checked for this task.</li>
<li>Assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).</li>
<li>Asuume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).</li>
</ol>

<li>if you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again</li>
<li>Should not remove the path before the name of the program</li>
</ol>
<h4>Task 1:</h4>
<ol>
<li>A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.</li>
<li>Program should print a number, followed by a new line</li>
</ol>
<h4>Task 2:</h4>

<li>All arguments should be printed, including the first one</li>
<li>Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line</li>
</ol>
<h4>Task 3:</h4>
<ol>
<li>A program that multiplies two numbers.</li>
<li>Program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line</li>
<li>Can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer</li>
<li>If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1</li>
</ol>
<h4>Task 4:</h4>
<ol>
<li>A program that adds positive numbers.</li>
<li>Print the result, followed by a new line</li>
<li>If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line</li>
<li>If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1</li>
<li>Can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int</li>
